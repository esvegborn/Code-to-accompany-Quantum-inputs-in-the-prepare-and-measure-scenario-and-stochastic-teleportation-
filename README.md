# Code to accompany "Quantum inputs in the prepare and measure scenario and stochastic teleportation".

Here one can find the code in matlab that proves that there exist an entangled assisted random access code (RAC) that achieves the sucess probability in equation (27) of the paper titled "Quantum inputs in the prepare and measure scenario and stochastic teleportation".

The files are the following:

1. **measurements.mat**: Data containing Alice's and Bob's measurements
2. **optimal_EARAC**: calculates the success probability of the entangled assisted RAC
